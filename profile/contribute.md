# Contribution

Anybody can fork our open source repositories and contribute, but we have also private repositories that are accessible only to our core team members. A core tem member have direct access to private repositories. When you have direct access you can work in development branches and commit to main branch. Our mentors are also code maintainers.

**Guests**

As a guest/student or developer you can visit our homepage and start learning how to code. You do not have to register or login. We host two courses: Software Engineering and Programming Languages. You can learn principles of programming from zero to hero in shorter time than school. Our courses are focussed on fundamentals. For advanced programming you can follow documentation and work on projects. There is no schedule for courses, you can start learning any time and pause or continue in your own time.

**Community**

You can join our community on Discord, Google, Reddit or Twitter. After you join, you can claim a new role on Discord chat room. We do not have any registry or database and we do not collect e-mail addresses nor phone numbers. After you get a role you will receive an invitation for GitHub in your e-mail. You can accept this invitation to become member in our core team and get access to projects.

**Invitations**

* [Sage-Code Discord](https://discord.gg/fAEHfw8T)
* [Sage-Code Group](https://groups.google.com/g/sagecode)
* [Sage-Code Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sagecode/)

## Students

As a student, you can have access to extra resources, not available for guests. This include secret links and stage rooms where we share presentations and schedule work sessions. Students can make PR requests for open source projects.

## Developers

To become a developer on Sage-Code you must be active on Discord. Post some info about your goals and skills on our #team channel and read the rules. A mentor will send you DM for an interview and will assign you the role. Developers have direct access to some of our private projects and can work in developer branches.

## Mentor

Sage-Code mentors are professional developers with experience that we can trust. Instructors are moderators and code maintainers. As a mentor you can accept PR from students and you can merge code into main branch. To become an mentor you need to pass several exams and prove your skills. Mentors are our partners, and they have access to all private projects.

# Work environment

You can fork any of our repositories. We do not accept PR requests from random visitors that we don't know. You must connect with a Mentor or Developer who can merge PR requests. We advice you to avoid extra work. As a mentor you can clone our repositories instead of forking. You will be able to work in branches and direct commit. We will merge the branches into main branch from time to time, or you can do it yourself.

## Structure

```
~/sagecode
    |
    +-->cse
    |
    +-->csp
    |
    +-->vip
    | (other projects)
    | ....
    +-->www (root)
    |    +-->images
    |    index.html
    |    sage.css
    |    projects.html
    |    services.html
```

Our website is distributed in many repositories. The main repository is the /www repository. This contains www/images folder and the root files. When you work on a project you can clone a specific repository. We use absolute path for some images and for style. Only mentors can close /www repository nobody else.

## Projects

Usually a developer work on a single project. You can clone our projects in the same working folder. For example ~/sage/eve/ or ~/sage/csp. After you clone a project, you can modify and test your work locally. The website should look good on your laptop. After you merge the code into a project your job is to send notification to one of the mentors for code review. Every project has a readme.md file you need to read to get familiar with the project setup.

## Your Rolet

You can claim a role on Discord. Having a developer role on Discord is the first condition to work on our projects. Second you need a role on GitHub. If you are not invited to our organization you can't contribute to our projects directly, but you can clone the project anyhow. What you can't do is modify the project and push changes. For this you need a fork, then create a clone of the fork and push changes in your own repository. If you do so, you can make later a PR. A mentor can review your code and accept the changes. So you can contribute even if you are not a Sage-Code member after all.

## Get started

You can ask questions on Sage-Code general [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/sage-code/discussions) board. Every repository has also a discussion board and a read.me file that contains info about that particular project. Follow this info and update new info when you have it.

**Follow up:**

1. Visit: [Sage-Code Laboratory](https://sagecode.net)
2. Read the [Project page](https://sagecode.net/projects.html)

After these steps you are ready to contribute. You can open the website locally offline. You can't modify any of the files because you have not created a fork. If you are a Developer, join our Discord server and ask permision to push changes. We will have a short interview and if you are qualified we will grant you GitHub developer role. With this role you can contribute directly in the main branch.
